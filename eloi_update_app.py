            üì¶ Common Products:
            The rule indicates that **UHT-milk** is frequently purchased alongside other products such as **bottled water**, **other vegetables**, **rolls/buns**, **root vegetables**, and **sausage**. This suggests that **UHT-milk** is a staple item that often accompanies a variety of complementary products.

            üîó Strength of Association:
            The **lift** values in the table are around **0.76 to 0.82**, which suggests a **moderate positive correlation** between **UHT-milk** and its associated products. This implies that these items tend to be bought together, but the association is not extremely strong.

            üí° Confidence Levels:
            The **confidence** values range from **0.05 to 0.1**, indicating that while there is some likelihood that customers purchasing one item will also buy the associated item, the probability is relatively low. For example, if a customer buys **UHT-milk**, there‚Äôs about a **5-10%** chance they will also purchase the other associated product.

            ü§ù Potential for Cross-Selling:
            Given these relationships, marketing strategies such as **bundling** **UHT-milk** with the associated products (e.g., **other vegetables** or **bottled water**) could be effective in increasing sales. Offering discounts on complementary items could encourage customers to purchase them together.

            ‚úÖ Conclusion:
            While **UHT-milk** shows moderate associations with other products, the **confidence** and **lift** values suggest there is room for improvement in making these associations more robust. Focused marketing and **product bundling** strategies could be effective in capitalizing on these moderate associations.
